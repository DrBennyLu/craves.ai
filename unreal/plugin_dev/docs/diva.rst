DIVA data visualization
=======================

DIVA is experimental for the potential of using synthetic data

In the DIVA folder, several scripts are used to convert the data format and perform visualization.

- diva/check_format.py # Make sure the format is consistent as the spec I wrote
- diva/vis_2d_kp.py
- diva/vis_activity.py # Visualize activity in the video
